# E-commerce
This is the Frontend Application for E-commerce(there is no backend service linked with this).  
It has Login, Home, Product view, My account and Cart pages.
Components are developed in a way that if we want to integrate our application with the APIs, we will be able to integrate with minimal changes.
Redux Toolkit is being used to manage the state of the application.
